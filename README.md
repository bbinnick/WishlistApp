### Project Structure üìÇ
The project follows a modular structure for better organization:

- app/: Contains the main screens and routing logic.
   - index.tsx: Home screen.
   - explore.tsx: Explore screen with app features.
   - _layout.tsx: Tab navigation layout.
- components/: Reusable components like WishlistContext, ThemedText, Collapsible, etc.
- screens/: Screens for specific app functionalities (e.g., HomeScreen, AddItemScreen, DetailsScreen).
- hooks/: Custom hooks like useColorScheme and useThemeColor.
- constants/: App-wide constants like colors.
- scripts/: Utility scripts (e.g., reset-project.js for resetting the app).

---

### Key Files üìÑ
- components/WishlistContext.tsx: Manages the wishlist state and SQLite integration.
- screens/AddItemScreen.tsx: Screen for adding or editing wishlist items.
- screens/HomeScreen.tsx: Displays the wishlist organized by categories.
- screens/DetailsScreen.tsx: Shows detailed information about a wishlist item.
- scripts/reset-project.js: Resets the app to a blank state for fresh development.

### How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
1. **Wishlist Management**:
   - Items are stored in an SQLite database.
   - The WishlistContext provides methods to add, update, delete, and load items.

2. **Navigation**:
   - Uses React Navigation for stack and tab-based navigation.
   - File-based routing is implemented with Expo Router.

3. **Theming**:
   - Light and dark themes are supported using useColorScheme and useThemeColor.

4. **Web View**:
   - Opens item URLs in a web view using react-native-webview.

### Resetting the Project üîÑ
To reset the app to a blank state:

1. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run reset-project

2. This will:
   - Move the current app/ directory to app-example/.
   - Create a new blank app/ directory with starter files.
